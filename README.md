In the problem, the calculated value must be stored as a number, but I stored it as a string. Then, when storing the month value, I stored it as the name of the month, so I didn't write the value and then wrote the name of the month. Then, when I entered the value in the input box, it didn't convert at all, it converted when I pressed the mouse to exit. Then, I didn't use THB when entering the amount. Then, I didn't decorate the webpage beautifully, so I'm not very good at organizing the components.
